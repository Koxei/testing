        <p class="p">
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between <code><</code> and <code>></code> characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.

        <p class="p">Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.

        <h2 class="topic">What is JAVA Platform?</h2>
        <p class="p">
        Java Platform is a collection of programs that help programmers to develop and run Java programming applications efficiently. It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. It is a set of computer software and specifications. James Gosling developed the Java platform at Sun Microsystems, and the Oracle Corporation later acquired it.

        <h1 class="topic">What is JAVASCRIPT?</h1>
        <p class="p">
            JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
        </p>
        <h2 class="topic">Why is it called <code>Java</code>Script?</h2>
        <p class="p">
            When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help. But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine. The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”. Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

            CSS

        <h1 class="topic">What is CSS? And how does it relate to HTML?</h1>
        <p class="p">
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).</p>
            <h2 class="topic">How does CSS work?</h2>
            <p class="p">
                CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page—for instance a paragraph—which in HTML might look like this:
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is my paragraph!&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                If you wanted to make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like this:
                <code>p  {  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }</code>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the part of CSS code specifying which HTML element the CSS styling will effect. In CSS, the selector is written to the left of the first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains properties and values that are applied to the selector. Properties are things like font size, color, and margins, while values are the settings for those properties. In the example above, “color” and “font-weight” are both properties, and “pink” and “bold” are values. The full bracketed set of
                <code>{  color:pink;  font-weight:bold;  }</code>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                is the declaration, and again, “p” (meaning the HTML paragraph) is the selector. These same basic principles can be applied to change font sizes, background colors, margin indentations, and more. For instance. . .
                <code>body  {  background-color:lightblue;  }</code>
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                . . .would make your page’s background light blue, or. . .
                <code>p  {  font-size:20px;  color:red;  }</code>
                . . .will create a 20 point font paragraph with red letters.
            </p>
            <p class="p">

        <p class="p">
            Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.

        <p class="p">
            Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

            Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:
